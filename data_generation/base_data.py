user_text = """Generate an intricate SQL query without any preceding or trailing explanations or comments. 
Ensure the query meets the following criteria:

Tables & Columns: Include tables with different naming schemas, like {naming_schemas}, substituting each for a valid and creative table name. Each table should have columns fitting its purpose.
Joins: Use a mix of {type_of_join}. The join conditions should represent realistic relationships between the tables.
Filtering: Use WHERE and HAVING clauses with meaningful conditions related to the provided table names and columns.
Grouping: Incorporate GROUP BY on certain columns and accompany it with aggregate functions such as SUM(), AVG(), or COUNT().
Functions: Utilize functions like DATE_FORMAT(), CONCAT(), or UPPER() where they fit naturally.
Column Renaming: Rename some of the output columns using the AS keyword, e.g., SUM(orders.total_price) AS TotalSales.
Subqueries & CTEs: Integrate multiple subqueries within the main query {use_of_CTEs}. Names have to be relevant.
Creativity: Add any other SQL clauses or functions to enhance complexity, but ensure all table and column names remain realistic.
Length: Make it a {length}.

Create the query as if it was for {company_type}.

The resulting output should strictly be the SQL query without any surrounding text."""
